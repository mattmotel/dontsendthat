# Don't Send That ðŸš«ðŸ“§

A cathartic app that lets you write passive-aggressive LinkedIn posts and emails, then gives you satisfying AI-generated responses without actually sending anything. Perfect for venting frustration in a safe space!

## What it does

- **LinkedIn Tab**: Write that thought-leadership post you've been holding back, get 10 validating comments from AI
- **Gmail Tab**: Draft that passive-aggressive email to your annoying coworker, get a satisfying response

## Features

- ðŸŽ­ **Fake LinkedIn interface** - Write posts and get supportive/roasting comments
- ðŸ“§ **Fake Gmail interface** - Compose emails and receive cathartic responses  
- ðŸ¤– **AI-powered responses** - Uses OpenAI to generate satisfying feedback
- ðŸŽ¨ **Smooth animations** - Comments and responses appear with nice transitions
- ðŸ”’ **Local only** - Nothing is stored or sent anywhere (that's the whole point!)
- âš¡ **No persistence** - Refresh to clear everything, like it never happened

## Setup

1. Clone and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. (Optional) Add your OpenAI API key for better responses:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your OpenAI API key
   ```
   
   Without an API key, the app will use fallback responses that are still satisfying!

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start venting!
